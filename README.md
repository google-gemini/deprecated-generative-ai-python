# [Deprecated] Google AI Python SDK for the Gemini API

With Gemini 2.0, we took the chance to create a single unified SDK for all developers who want to use Google's GenAI models (Gemini, Veo, Imagen, etc). As part of that process, we took all of the feedback from this SDK and what developers like about other SDKs in the ecosystem to create the [Google Gen AI SDK](https://github.com/googleapis/python-genai). 

The full migration guide from the old SDK to new SDK is available in the [Gemini API docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/migrate).

We won't be adding anything to this SDK or making any further changes. The Gemini API docs are fully updated to show examples of the new Google Gen AI SDK. We know how disruptive an SDK change can be and don't take this change lightly, but our goal is to create an extremely simple and clear path for developers to build with our models so it felt necessary to make this change.

Thank you for building with Gemini and [let us know](https://discuss.ai.google.dev/c/gemini-api/4) if you need any help!
